# SimpleQuizApplication - A PHP_MySQL based quiz application

This app is very rudimentary, something I developed for a technical event at college.

The quiz.sql includes the structure of the database and also some data that enables you to test the application.

Hardcoded to have 20 questions per test and gives the team to 45 seconds to answer each question. You can easily change these by just taking a glance at the quiz.php file.
